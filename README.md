dataset are collected  from kaggle.com and various machine learning analysis is done.
few of the alogithm used in this project are:

1.linear regression. 

2.decision tree regreession.

3.random forest regression.

4.SVM

5.adaboosting.

6.gradient desecent.

Hence, at the end, we were successfully able to train our regression model ‘Gradient Boosting Regressor’ to predict the flights of prices with an r2_score of 87%, 
and have achieved the required task successfully we aslo predicted the test dataset and submission csv is created.
